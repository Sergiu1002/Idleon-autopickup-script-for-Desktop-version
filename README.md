# Idleon_autopickup4snelbies
It's a script to auto pick up the loot while active afk.
Requires:
1. Python 3 (install from https://www.python.org/)
2. Packages pynput and keyboard (after you installed python, type cmd into windows search and type: pip install keyboard AND pip install pynput. It should work after these steps, if not, contact me.)

You run it by just double clicking the file.
You stop it by pressing f1.
I also got another script working for any map. It's not a great one but it works. If you need it, contact me.
