# Idleon_autopickup4snelbies
It's a script to auto pick up the loot while active afk. Works only if you don't interact with your pc. So it's best suited to run overnight or while you do something else.
It's also a somewhat brute force type of script, by this i mean it does not click specific images such as coins, it just goes on to a loop from left to right while pressing mouse1 button.

Requires:
1. Python 3 (install from https://www.python.org/)
2. Packages pynput and keyboard (after you install python, type cmd into windows search and type: pip install keyboard AND pip install pynput. It should work.
3. Playing fullscreen 1920x1080


You run it by just double clicking the file.
You stop it by pressing f1.
You can easily modify the file to suit your needs. 
I made the script because i needed the cards, stamps, books from crystal crabs and also to pick up anything else while the spearman active gridns exp.
